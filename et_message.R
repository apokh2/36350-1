Dear Extraterrestrial Being

I hope your understanding of communication is nuanced enough to find the English language at least
nominally comprehensible! In that case, I have a few questions: 
  
  1. What is your populace's average lifespan?
  2. How do you communicate in your planet?
  3. What would you say is your civilization's most imppresive technological development or innovation?

Thank you for your attention
